			       Porting

	Porting the editor is a relatively simple task. Most of the
code is pretty machine-independent. For each environment, there is
a file of routines that perform various low-level operations that
tend to vary a lot from one machine to another. Another file contains
the escape sequences to be used for each machine.

Note however that 'char' is treated as unsigned so you need to set the
appropriate compiler flags if this is not the default.

	The machine-dependent files currently used are:

tos.c:	 Atari ST - ifdef for either Megamax or Alcyon
tos.h

unix.c:	 UNIX System V
unix.h

os9.c:	 OS9 version 2.2
os9.h

os2.c:	 Microsoft OS/2
os2.h

dos.c:   MS DOS
dos.h

amiga.c: Amiga
amiga.h

bsd.c:   BSD 4.3 UNIX
bsd.h

	Each of these files are around 150 lines long and deal with
low-level issues like character I/O to the terminal, terminal
initialization, cursor addressing, and so on. There are different
tradeoffs to be made depending on the environment. For example, the
UNIX version buffers terminal output because of the relatively high
overhead of system calls. A quick look at the files will make it clear
what needs to be done in a new environment.

	Terminal escape sequences are in the file "term.h". These are
defined statically, for the time being. There is some discussion in
term.h regarding which sequences are optional and which are not. The
editor is somewhat flexible in dealing with a lack of terminal
capabilities.

	The character set is in the file "charset.c".

	Because not all C compilers support command line macro definitions,
the #define's for system-specific macros are placed in the file "env.h".
If you port to a new system, add another line there to define the macro you
choose for your port.

	The basic process for doing a new port is:

	1. Come up with a macro name to use when ifdef'ing your system-
	   specific changes. Add a line to 'env.h' to define
	   the macro name you've chosen.

	2. Look at amiga.c, bsd.c, unix.c, tos.c, dos.c and os2.c and copy the
	   one that comes closest to working on your system. Then modify your
	   new file as needed.

	3. Look at term.h and edit the file appropriately adding a new
	   set of escape sequence definitions for your system.

	4. Compiling and debug the editor.
